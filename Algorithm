An algortihm is a set of well defined instructions to solve a particular problem
It is the recipe aka process to preparing a meal with its ingredients aka inputs
It must have inputs and outputs
Each step should be clear and unambiguous
Language independent
The absolute running time of an algorithm cannotbe predicted and depends on a number of factors
1. Programming language used to implement the algorithm
2. The computer the program runs on
3. Other program running time
4. Quality of the operating system
5. Input size
    5(a). Time complexity
    5(b). Space complexity


Asymptotic notations : Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity
1. Big O Notation (O Notation) - Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation () - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation (Ã¸ Notation) - Average case complexity

Big O Notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms and has two important characteristics
1. It is expressed in terms of the input
2. It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in minute details


A lopp's worst case is Linear time complexity although there are exceptions O(n)
Constant time complexity 
Double loop will give quadratic time complexity
Triple would be cubic time complexity

Space complexity O(logn) Logarithmic complexity
